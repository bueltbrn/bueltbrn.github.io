# Data-Science-Portfolio

In this repo I want to work on a Data Science Portfolio, were I upload me own Projects, to get a job in the future as a Data Scientist.

This portfolio is based on a Youtubevideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZ1Hj5yQ-8&ab_channel=KenJee
In this Video the dataprofessor shows step-by-step how to create a portfolio using HUGO nad Github.
He uses the IDE ATOM, I used Jupyter Notebook for this Project.
